Implementation of Flask Login Using GCP Datastore

The flask-login Plugin is a quick and light weight way of implementing user login in your flask applications
https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Login/

If you have a cloud native application that sits on Google Cloud Project (GCP), you can use GCP Datastore to store your User data.
This is a quick implementation of the same, which implements everything that Flask-Login wants you to implement.

* The User class
* The method of the user_loader callback

Just import and you are good to go !
